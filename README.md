**ERC20 and Vault Contracts README**

## Introduction

Welcome to the ERC20 and Vault Contracts repository! This repository contains Solidity smart contracts for ERC20 token implementation and a vault contract for securely managing and storing tokens.

## ERC20 Contract

The ERC20 contract in this repository implements the ERC20 standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC20 tokens are widely used for creating digital currencies and managing assets in decentralized applications (dApps).

### Features

- ERC20 compliant: Implements all the required functions and events specified by the ERC20 standard.
- Customizable: Allows customization of token name, symbol, decimals, and initial token supply during deployment.
- Secure: Designed to follow best practices in smart contract security.

### Usage

1. **Deploy**: Deploy the ERC20 contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a compatible Ethereum development environment such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

2. **Initialize**: During deployment, specify the token name, symbol, decimals, and initial token supply.

3. **Interact**: Interact with the deployed ERC20 contract using Ethereum wallet interfaces such as MetaMask or programmatically through Ethereum smart contract calls.

## Vault Contract

The Vault contract in this repository provides a secure way to manage and store ERC20 tokens. It acts as a custodian for tokens, allowing authorized users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer tokens securely.

### Features

- Access control: Implements role-based access control to manage permissions for depositing, withdrawing, and transferring tokens.
- Security: Utilizes best practices for secure token storage, including proper handling of permissions and minimizing attack vectors.
- Auditable: Provides transparency through event logs for all token movements and interactions.
